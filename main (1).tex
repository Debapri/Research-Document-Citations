\section*{Introduction}

Climate change has emerged as one of the most significant challenges of the 21st century, affecting ecosystems, biodiversity, and human livelihoods. The agricultural sector, in particular, is highly vulnerable to the effects of climate change due to its reliance on stable weather patterns \cite{porter2014climate, schlenker2009nonlinear}. Changes in temperature and precipitation patterns have already started to impact crop yields in various regions of the world \cite{lobell2011climate, hatfield2011climate}. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) projects that the impacts on agriculture will vary by region, with some areas experiencing reduced productivity while others may see temporary gains \cite{ipcc2014climate}. However, these gains are likely to be offset by increased frequency of extreme weather events such as droughts and floods \cite{wheeler2013climate, smith2014agriculture}.

\section*{Discussion}

In response to these challenges, researchers and policymakers are exploring a variety of adaptation strategies to ensure food security in a changing climate \cite{howden2007adapting, nelson2009climate}. These strategies include the development of climate-resilient crop varieties, improved water management practices, and the adoption of agroecological approaches that enhance the resilience of farming systems \cite{altieri2009agroecology, vermeulen2012climate}. Moreover, the role of technology in mitigating the impacts of climate change on agriculture cannot be overstated \cite{tilman2011global, searchinger2018world}. Advances in remote sensing, data analytics, and precision agriculture offer new opportunities to optimize resource use and minimize environmental impacts \cite{kamilaris2018using, puma2015assessing}. Despite these advances, significant challenges remain, particularly in developing countries where access to technology and resources is limited \cite{fao2018state, godfray2010food}.
